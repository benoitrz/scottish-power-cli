# Scottish Power CLI

Simple CLI program that fetches account data (including balance) from Scottish Power and display it within the console.

## Why?

I have to use the Scottish Power website from time to time and I am not a big fan of it.
I also am not interested in downloading their app (it may be better).

## How to use it?

1. Set you Scottish Power credentials in the config.js file.
2. Run npm start
